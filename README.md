<h1>CMD Projects:</h1>
<h3>First of all let’s see what CMD is.</h3>
<p aling justify>CMD is an acronym for Command. Command prompt or CMD is the command line interpreter of Windows operating systems. It is similar to Command.com used in DOS and Windows 9x systems where it is called as “MS-DOS Prompt”. It is analogous to Unix Shells used on Unix like system. The command prompt is a native application of the Windows operating system and gives the user an option to perform operations using commands.
Command prompt makes use of the command line interface to interact with the User. In the Windows operating system, this command prompt interface is implemented through the Win32 console. User can open the interface by via the CMD run command or by going to its original location C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe.</p>
